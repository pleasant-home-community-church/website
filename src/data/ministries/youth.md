Our purpose is to honor God in all that we do by faithfully grounding ourselves in the truth of the Bible. We seek to equip students with the knowledge and tools to deepen their relationship with God, encouraging them to live out their faith boldly and authentically in their daily lives. Through fellowship, worship, and discipleship, we aim to inspire a generation to know and follow God wholeheartedly.  
  
Colossians 2:6-7  
Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
