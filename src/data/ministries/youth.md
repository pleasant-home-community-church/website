Lead by Pastor Jason Evans

The purpose of ROOTED is to:

* Come alongside the parents to help the students grow in the Lord. The ministry is not in competition with the family, but in allegiance to it, as the family is also in allegiance to the church.
* See believing students become complete in Christ, using their spiritual gifts and talents to serve the local body and the universal body around the world.
* Evangelize to the unbelieving students in the greater Gresham area.
* See every youth (grades 6-12) have a passionate and personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
