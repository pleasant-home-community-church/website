  "bio": "Syd earned a Bachelor’s degree in Pastoral ministry and New Testament Greek from The Moody Bible Institute. He also earned a Master of Arts in Old Testament Literature from Western Seminary. He has served as lead, teaching pastor in three churches over a period of 50 years.\n\nSyd likes to say that he is “retreaded,” rather than retired, since pastors shouldn’t stop using their gifts. He is grateful to be serving at Troutdale Community Church.\nHis passion is teaching the Bible by encouraging students to “get into the story.” He has authored the book, God in His Own Image: Loving God for Who He is Not Who We Want Him to Be, published by Moody Publishers. He has enjoyed ministering in several foreign countries, especially to the persecuted church.\n\nBackpacking and fishing were his hobbies when younger, but now he enjoys mentoring men, reading, following the Oregon Ducks and the Nebraska Huskers since he was born and raised in Nebraska.\n\nMary and Syd have two sons, five grandchildren and five great grandchildren."
